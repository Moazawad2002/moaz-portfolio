## 🌾 Overview & Purpose

**Al Amal Distribution Management System** is a standalone, offline-ready Windows desktop ERP engineered for food distributors in Cairo and the regional Egyptian market. 

Built with the company's signature brand identity (Wheat Amber Gold `#D49B24`, Charcoal Bronze `#1E1B15`, and Warm Cream `#FAF7EE`), it provides dedicated role-based operational modules:
1. **Executive CEO Suite:** Complete company oversight, live central inventory, gross profit margins, cash treasury vs. operational expenses, and receivables aging.
2. **Field Sales Representatives (3 Territories):** Isolated route dashboards enforcing territory boundaries via **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)** for sales invoicing, order creation, and collections.

## ⚙️ Core System Modules

- **Collections & Receivables Aging:** Tracks cash receipts, reconciles customer ledger balances, and categorizes overdue receivables.

## 🧪 Automated Testing Suite

The repository includes automated test suites verifying business integrity:
```bash
# Execute automated test suite
npm test
```
Tests cover:
- `auth.test.ts`: RLS isolation ensuring representatives cannot access out-of-territory records.
- `inventory.test.ts`: Prevents negative stock dispatches and verifies atomic reservation.
- `financial.test.ts`: Mathematical validation of subtotal, VAT (14%), discounts, and cash balances.
